# λΠ

Toy dependent typechecker using normalization by evaluation for fun and
absolutely no profit. Based off of [András Kovács' Elaboration Zoo -
03-holes](https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/elaboration-zoo/) and [David
Christiansen's tutorial](https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/nbe/), but using
names instead of de Bruijn indices
